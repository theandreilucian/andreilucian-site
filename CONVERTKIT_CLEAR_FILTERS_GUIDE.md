   - Login with your email and password

2. **Navigate to Subscribers:**
   - Click **"Subscribers"** in the left sidebar
   - Or go directly to: https://convertkit.com/subscribers

---

## 🔍 Step 2: Check Current Filter/View

Look at the top of the subscribers page. You should see:

### A. Check Filter Dropdown

1. **Look for dropdown menu** near the top (usually says something like):
   - "All Subscribers"
   - "Tagged"
   - "Untagged"
   - "Custom Segment"
   - Or shows a tag name (e.g., "Newsletter", "Free Trial")

2. **Click the dropdown** to see what's selected

3. **If it shows anything OTHER than "All Subscribers":**
   - Click the dropdown
   - Select **"All Subscribers"** from the list
   - This clears the filter

---

### B. Check for Search Filters

1. **Look for search bar** (usually says "Search subscribers...")

2. **Check if there's any text** in the search box

3. **If there's text:**
   - Click the search box
   - Delete all text
   - Press "Enter" or click "Clear"

---

### C. Check for Date Range Filters

1. **Look for date range options** (might say "Last 30 days", "This month", etc.)

2. **If a date range is selected:**
   - Click the date dropdown
   - Select **"All Time"** or **"All Subscribers"**
   - This removes date filter

---

### D. Check for Tag/Segment Filters

1. **Look for tag buttons** or segment selectors

2. **If any tags are selected** (showing as colored buttons/pills):
   - Click the "X" on each tag button to remove it
   - Or click "Clear Filters" button if available

---

## ✅ Step 3: Clear All Selections

1. **Look at the subscriber list:**
   - Check if any checkboxes are selected (checked boxes next to subscriber names)

2. **If checkboxes are selected:**
   - Look for **"Select All"** or **"Deselect All"** button
   - Click **"Deselect All"** to uncheck everything
   - Or manually uncheck each box

3. **Verify no subscribers are selected:**
   - All checkboxes should be empty/unchecked
   - The export should say "Export All Subscribers" not "Export Selected"

---

## 📊 Step 4: Verify Total Subscriber Count

### Method A: Check Top of Page

1. **Look at the top of the subscribers list:**
   - You should see text like: **"X Subscribers"** or **"Total: X"**

2. **Check the number:**
   - Should say **"600 Subscribers"** (or close to 600)
   - If it says **"26 Subscribers"**, a filter is still active

3. **If it shows 26:**
   - Go back to Step 2 and check filters again
   - Make sure "All Subscribers" is selected

---

### Method B: Check Pagination

1. **Look at the bottom of the subscriber list:**
   - Check for page numbers (1, 2, 3...) or "Page 1 of X"

2. **If pagination exists:**
   - It should show something like "Page 1 of 24" (if 25 per page, 600 total = 24 pages)
   - If it says "Page 1 of 1", only 26 subscribers are showing (filter is active)

---

### Method C: Count Visible Subscribers

1. **Scroll through the subscriber list**

2. **Check how many subscribers are visible:**
   - Should see many pages/subscribers (not just 26)
   - If you only see 26 subscribers total, a filter is active

---

## 🔄 Step 5: Clear Everything (Complete Reset)

If you're still not seeing all 600 subscribers:

1. **Click "All Subscribers"** in the filter dropdown
2. **Clear search box** (delete any text)
3. **Remove date range filters** (select "All Time")
4. **Remove tag filters** (click X on any tag buttons)
5. **Deselect all subscribers** (uncheck all checkboxes)
6. **Refresh the page** (press F5 or click refresh)
7. **Check total count again**

---
