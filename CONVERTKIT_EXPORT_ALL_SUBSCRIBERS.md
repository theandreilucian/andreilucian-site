# 🔧 ConvertKit Export Fix - Get All 600 Subscribers (Not Just 26)

## The Problem
When you export from ConvertKit, you only get 26 subscribers in the CSV file instead of all 600 subscribers.

---

## ✅ Solution 1: Export from Subscribers Page (Main Method)

### Step 1: Go to Subscribers Page

1. **Login to ConvertKit:**
   - Go to: https://convertkit.com
   - Login with your credentials

2. **Navigate to Subscribers:**
   - Click **"Subscribers"** in the left sidebar
   - Or go to: https://convertkit.com/subscribers

---

### Step 2: Clear All Filters

1. **Check Filter Dropdown (top of page):**
   - Should say **"All Subscribers"**
   - If it says anything else (like "Tagged", "Untagged", or a tag name):
     - Click the dropdown
     - Select **"All Subscribers"**

2. **Clear Search Box:**
   - If there's any text in the search box, delete it
   - Make sure search box is empty

3. **Remove Tag Filters:**
   - If any tag buttons/pills are visible, click the X to remove them
   - No tags should be selected

4. **Check Date Range:**
   - If there's a date filter, set it to **"All Time"** or remove it

---

### Step 3: Deselect All Subscribers

1. **Check if any subscribers are selected:**
   - Look for checkboxes next to subscriber names
   - If any are checked (selected):
     - Click **"Deselect All"** button (if available)
     - Or manually uncheck each box

2. **Verify:**
   - No checkboxes should be selected
   - Export should say "Export All Subscribers" not "Export Selected"

---

### Step 4: Verify Total Count

**At the top of the subscribers page, check:**
- Should show **"600 Subscribers"** (or your total)
- If it shows **"26 Subscribers"**, a filter is still active
- Go back to Step 2 and clear filters again

---

### Step 5: Export All Subscribers

1. **Click Export Button:**
   - Look for **"Export"** button (usually top-right)
   - **DO NOT** use "Bulk Actions → Export" (that only exports selected)
   - Use the main **"Export"** button

2. **Select Export Options:**
   - Format: **"CSV"**
   - What to export: **"All Subscribers"** (not "Selected" or a specific tag)
   - Date Range: **"All Time"** (if option exists)

3. **Click Export/Download:**
   - Wait for the file to download
   - ConvertKit will process the export
   - You might get an email when it's ready, or it downloads directly

---

## ✅ Solution 2: Export from Settings

If Solution 1 doesn't work:

1. **Go to Settings:**
   - Click your profile/account icon (top-right)
   - Select **"Settings"**
   - Or go to: https://convertkit.com/account/settings

2. **Find Subscribers Export:**
   - Look for **"Export Subscribers"** or **"Download CSV"** option
   - This should export ALL subscribers without pagination

3. **Export:**
   - Click the export button
   - Select "CSV" format
   - Select "All Subscribers"
   - Download the file

---

## ✅ Solution 3: Check Export Email

If ConvertKit sends you an email with the export:

1. **Check the email** from ConvertKit (might be from "Kit" or "ConvertKit")
2. **Click the download link**
3. **Check if there are export options** on the download page:
   - "Export All Subscribers" vs "Export Selected"
   - "Full Export" vs "Sample Export"
4. **If options exist**, select "Export All" or "Full Export"

---

## 🔍 Verify Export File

After downloading:

1. **Open the CSV file** in Excel or Google Sheets
2. **Scroll to the bottom**
3. **Count total rows:**
   - Should be **601 rows** (600 subscribers + 1 header row)
   - Row 1 = Header (Email, First Name, etc.)
   - Rows 2-601 = Your 600 subscribers

4. **If still only 27 rows** (26 + header):
   - Export is still limited
   - Try Solutions above
   - Or contact ConvertKit support

---

## ⚠️ If Still Only 26 Subscribers

### Contact ConvertKit Support

1. **Go to ConvertKit Support:**
   - Visit: https://convertkit.com/support
   - Or email: support@convertkit.com

2. **Create Support Ticket:**

   **Subject:** Export only shows 26 subscribers instead of 600

   **Message:**
   ```
   Hi ConvertKit Support,

   I'm experiencing an issue with the subscriber export function. 
   When I export subscribers, I only receive 26 subscribers in the 
   CSV file instead of all 600 subscribers.

   Details:
   - Total Subscribers: 600 (confirmed in dashboard)
   - Exported Subscribers: 26
   - Export Method: Subscribers page → Export button → CSV format

   Steps I've tried:
   1. Cleared all filters (set to "All Subscribers")
   2. Deselected all subscribers before exporting
   3. Used main Export button (not bulk actions)
   4. Selected "All Subscribers" in export options
   5. Tried exporting from Settings

   The exported CSV file only contains 27 rows (26 subscribers + 
   1 header) instead of the expected 601 rows (600 subscribers + 
   1 header).

   Please help me export all 600 subscribers. This is urgent as I 
   need to migrate them to another platform.

   Thank you!
   ```

3. **Ask them to:**
   - Fix the export function
   - Manually export all 600 subscribers for you
   - Or provide alternative export method
