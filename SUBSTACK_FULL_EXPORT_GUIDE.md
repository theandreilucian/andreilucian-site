# 🔧 How to Export ALL 593 Subscribers from Substack

## Problem
You're only getting 26 subscribers exported instead of 593.

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Solution

### Step 1: Go to Settings → Subscribers Export

**This is the most reliable method:**

1. **Login to Substack:**
   - Go to: https://substack.com/dashboard
   - Login to your account

2. **Go to Settings:**
   - Click "Settings" (gear icon) at the bottom of the left sidebar
   - Or go to: `https://substack.com/dashboard/settings`

3. **Find Subscribers Section:**
   - Scroll down to find "Subscribers" or "Email" section
   - Look for "Export Subscribers" or "Download CSV" button
   - This should export ALL subscribers without pagination limits

---

### Step 2: Alternative - Check Export Options

If Step 1 doesn't work, try this:

1. **Go to Subscribers Page:**
   - Click "Subscribers" under AUDIENCE in left sidebar
   - Or: `https://theandreilucian.substack.com/publish/subscribers`

2. **Clear ALL Filters:**
   - Make sure dropdown shows "All Subscribers" (not "Confirmed" or any filter)
   - Check if there's a date range filter - clear it
   - Make sure no search filters are active

3. **Deselect Everything:**
   - Click "Deselect All" or uncheck "Select All"
   - Don't export selected subscribers

4. **Look for Main Export Button:**
   - Find "Export" or "Download CSV" button (usually top-right, NOT in bulk actions)
   - Click it
   - Wait for full export (might take a moment for 593 subscribers)

---

### Step 3: Check if Pagination is the Issue

Substack might be exporting only the visible page (first 25-50 subscribers).

**Solution:**
1. **Try exporting from different views:**
   - Scroll to bottom of subscriber list
   - Make sure all pages are loaded (if paginated)
   - Then try export again

2. **Or use Settings export (Step 1)** - this should bypass pagination

---

### Step 4: Contact Substack Support

If you've tried everything and still only get 26 subscribers:

1. **Report the Issue:**
   - Go to: https://substack.com/support
   - Create a support ticket
   - Explain: "I have 593 total subscribers but export only shows 26 subscribers"

2. **Provide Details:**
   - Total subscribers: 593
   - Exported subscribers: 26
   - What you tried: Settings export, clearing filters, etc.
   - Ask them to fix the export function

---

### Step 5: Workaround - Export in Batches (If Needed)

If Substack support can't help immediately, try this:

1. **Export by Date Range:**
   - Export subscribers from last 90 days
   - Export older subscribers separately
   - Combine CSV files manually

2. **Export by Status:**
   - Export "Confirmed" subscribers
   - Export "Unconfirmed" separately
   - Combine manually

3. **Use Multiple Exports:**
   - Export page 1 (first 50 subscribers)
   - Export page 2 (next 50)
   - Continue until you have all 593
   - Combine all CSV files

## 🎯 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Tried Settings → Subscribers → Export
- [ ] Cleared all filters (set to "All Subscribers")
- [ ] Deselected all subscribers before exporting
- [ ] Used main "Export" button (not bulk actions)
- [ ] Checked CSV file - still only 26 rows?
- [ ] Contacted Substack support if still not working

---

## Expected Result

After proper export, your CSV should have:
- **594 rows total** (593 subscribers + 1 header row)
- All subscriber emails in column B
- All subscriber data in other columns

---

## If Still Only 26 Subscribers

This appears to be a **Substack bug** where:
- Export is paginated and only exports first page
- Or export has a hidden limit
- Or export is broken for accounts with many subscribers

**Your options:**
1. Contact Substack support (best option)
2. Export in batches (workaround)
3. Use Substack API if available (requires developer access)

**Try the Settings export first - that's usually the most reliable method!** 🚀
